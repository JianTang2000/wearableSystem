The 'arduino_project' folder contains C code (functional program) for A-skin.
This code defines how to read data from the sensors and control the actuators based on that data.
To upload this functional program to the chip (ATMEGA328P), you first need to set up a bootloader programming circuit, burn the bootloader onto the chip, then set up a circuit for uploading the functional program, and finally, upload the functional program to the chip.

The 'eda_project' folder contains schematic and PCB designs. Please import it using the EDA software (version 6.5.28) available at [https://lceda.cn/].
